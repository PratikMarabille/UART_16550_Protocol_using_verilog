## UART_16550_Protocol_using_verilog
The UART 16550 is a popular asynchronous communication interface that is widely used for serial data transmission between devices. It is an improved version of earlier UART models and includes features that enhance its efficiency and flexibility in data communication.


## Key features include
* FIFO Buffers
* Configurable Baud Rate
* Programmable Word Length
* Parity and Stop Bits
* Line Status Register (LSR)
